# Motion-Detection-with-Python-and-OpenCV

A motion detector built using Python and OpenCV documentation.Through the program, we can access our webcam and detect any motion in front of it and we can record the intervals 
where motion was observed in the webcam in a CSV file via pandas.
Using the  Bokeh plotting library, we can plot the csv file containing the start and end intervals of motion for better visualization.
